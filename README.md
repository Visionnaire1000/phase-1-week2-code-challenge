This project is a simple interactive shopping list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add items to a shopping list, mark items as purchased, edit them, delete individual items, and clear the entire list. The shopping list is persisted using local storage, ensuring that the data remains available even after the browser is closed.
