This project is a simple interactive shopping list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add items to a shopping list, mark items as purchased, edit them, delete individual items, and clear the entire list. The shopping list is persisted using local storage, ensuring that the data remains available even after the browser is closed.



## Features

1. **Add Items Button**: Users can add new items to the shopping list using an input field.
2. **Mark Items as Purchased**: Click an item to toggle its "purchased" status (indicated by strikethrough text and a different background color).
3. **Edit Items**: Double-click an item to edit its text.
4. **Delete Items Button**: Click the "Delete" button next to an item to remove it from the list.
5. **Clear List**: Remove all items from the list with a single button click.
6. **Persistence**: The shopping list is saved in local storage, so it is retained even after the browser is refreshed.
